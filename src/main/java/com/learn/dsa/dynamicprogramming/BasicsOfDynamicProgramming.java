1. Repetitive subproblems, also known as overlapping subproblems, occur when a complex problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems, 
	and the same subproblems are encountered and solved multiple times in the overall solution
2. "Top to bottom" refers to the top-down approach in dynamic programming, which uses memoization to solve problems
3. Tablulization : Tabulation is implemented iteratively, building up solutions from the smallest subproblems to the larger ones.
